# About 
 The idea behind this app is simple - to provide a tool that can help users avoid potential dangers. A user can take a picture of a potential threat, add a caption, upload it, and other Dawn users nearby will recieve an alert. In turn, these users can view the danger plotted on a map, view the image and see more information about it. This feature set is to be expanded.
 
# Background 
 This project is inspired by the events in Belarus following the August 2020 election. It strives to support the democratic resistance movement by providing an easy-to-use application that can help peaceful protesters stay aware of potential threats.
 
 This repository is for the client, and the server is available at https://github.com/dawnn-team/dawn_server. All components of this project are open source, and contributions are encouraged. More information can be found at dawnn.org (coming soon).
